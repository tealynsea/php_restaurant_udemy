====================
Udemy 48 lecture on learning php principles.
Went over: Syntax, variable, constants, arrays(simple, associative, multi-dimensional), if/else/ifelse stms,
  operators(comparison, logical, arithmetic, string, assignment), loops(while, for, foreach, do/while), functions, 
  and culminated in final project of dynamic website (no hard coding!) using php.
